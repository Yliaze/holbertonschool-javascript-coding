Web scraping is the process of extracting data from websites, and it's a valuable skill for collecting information, automating tasks, and more. You will learn how to harness the power of JavaScript to access web resources, manipulate JSON data, use the request and fetch APIs to make HTTP requests, and read and write files using the fs module. Understanding these concepts will empower you to gather data from the web effectively.

## Learning Objectives:

-   Why JavaScript programming is amazing
-   How to manipulate JSON data
